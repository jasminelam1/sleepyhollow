      but most times it could rarely happens at night for most of us.

          Poor sleep is linked to higher body weight
        </h1>

        <center class="color">
          Poor sleep is strongly linked to weight gain. People with short sleep
          duration tend to weigh significantly more than those who get adequate
          sleep In fact, short sleep duration is one of the strongest risk
          factors for obesity. In one extensive review study, children and
          adults with short sleep duration were 89% and 55% more likely to
          develop obesity, respectively The effect of sleep on weight gain is
          believed to be mediated by numerous factors, including hormones and
          motivation to exercise.

          Good sleepers tend to eat fewer calories
        </h1>

        <center class="color">
          Studies show that sleep-deprived individuals have a bigger appetite
          and tend to eat more calories. Sleep deprivation disrupts the daily
          fluctuations in appetite hormones and is believed to cause poor
          appetite regulation This includes higher levels of ghrelin, the
          hormone that stimulates appetite, and reduced levels of leptin, the
          hormone that suppresses appetite.

          Good sleep can improve concentration and productivity
        </h1>

        <center class="color">
          Sleep is important for various aspects of brain function. This
          includes cognition, concentration, productivity, and performance. All
          of these are negatively affected by sleep deprivation. A study on
          medical interns provides a good example. Interns on a traditional
          schedule with extended work hours of more than 24 hours made 36% more
          serious medical errors than interns on a schedule that allowed more
          sleep.

          Good sleep can maximize athletic performance
        </h1>

        <center class="color">
          Sleep has been shown to enhance athletic performance. In a study on
          basketball players, longer sleep was shown to significantly improve
          speed, accuracy, reaction times, and mental well-being. Less sleep
          duration has also been associated with poor exercise performance and
          functional limitation in older women. A study in over 2,800 women
          found that poor sleep was linked to slower walking, lower grip
          strength, and greater difficulty performing independent activities.

          Poor sleepers have a greater risk of heart disease and stroke
        </h1>

        <center class="color">
          Sleep quality and duration can have a major effect on many health risk
          factors. These are the factors believed to drive chronic diseases,
          including heart disease. A review of 15 studies found that people who
          don’t get enough sleep are at far greater risk of heart disease or
          stroke than those who sleep 7–8 hours per night.

        Poor sleep is linked to depression
      </h1>

      <center class="color">
        Mental health issues, such as depression, are strongly linked to poor
        sleep quality and sleeping disorders. It’s been estimated that 90% of
        people with depression complain about sleep quality. Poor sleep is even
        associated with an increased risk of death by suicide. Those with
        sleeping disorders like insomnia or obstructive sleep apnea also report
        significantly higher rates of depression than those without.
